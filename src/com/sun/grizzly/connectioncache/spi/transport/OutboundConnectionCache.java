/** A concurrent mostly non-blocking connection cache.  Here a Connection is an 
 * abstraction of a Socket or SocketChannel: basically some sort of resource 
 * that is expensive to acquire, and can be re-used freely.  The cache 
 * maintains a loose upper bound on the number of cached connections, and 
 * reclaims connections as needed.
 * <P>
 * This cache places minimal requirements on the Connections that it contains:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A Connection must implement a close() method.  This is called when idle
 * connections are reclaimed.
 * <li>A Connection must be usable as a HashMap key.  
 * <li>There must be a ContactInfo class that is used to create Connection 
 * instances.  The ContactInfo class must support a create() method that 
 * returns a Connection.
 * <li>The ContactInfo must be usable as a HashMap key.
 * <li>All instances created from a ContactInfo are equal; that is, any request
 * sent to a particular ContactInfo can used an instance created from that 
 * ContactInfo.  For example, in the CORBA case, IP host and port is not always
 * sufficient: we may also need the Codeset type that indicates how Strings are
 * encoded.  Basically, protocols (like GIOP) that bind session state to a 
 * Connection may need more than transport information in the ContactInfo.
 * </ol>
 * <P>
 * Some simple methods are provided for monitoring the state of the cache:
 * numbers of busy and idle connections, and the total number of connections in 
 * the cache.
